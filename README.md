## Work Experience

```
Senior Technologist , Infosys Jan 2023 – Present
```
- Designed and implemented data models and services to facilitate the migration from a monolithic architecture
    to a microservices-based architecture.
- Engineered a robust reconciliation framework leveraging Angular, Kafka, Express, and Node.js to efficiently
    detect and resolve data discrepancies during Day-0 migration.
- Conceived and implemented an operations portal that incorporates a suite of testing utilities for evaluating the
    functionality of individual micro-services.
- Java, springboot, Angular, Typescript, MongoDB, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Spinnaker.
**Specialist Programmer** , Infosys Aug 2019 – Dec 2022
- Designed and implemented a user-event tracking npm library that streamlined data flow to analytics platforms.
    This initiative decreased data processing time by 40%, allowing faster decision-making for marketing strategies.
- Created a tool to visualize JSON as flow-graph. This proved to be very useful for spotting the json-path of an
    attribute and reduced the overhead in analyzing JSON by 50%.
- Redesigned specific components within a larger application, incorporating reactive programming principles and
    an event-driven architecture. This approach enhanced the scalability of individual services by enabling them to
    independently scale horizontally.
- Java, springboot, ReactJS, MongoDB, Oracle, Kafka.
**Test Engineer** , Infosys Jan 2016 – Dec 2018
- Created a scaled-down workload model to accurately predict and plan for the capacity requirements of a
    client-facing application.
- Delivered a 50% throughput increase by optimizing server resource utilization through careful tuning of heap
    space, garbage collection strategy, and thread pool configurations.
- Java, bean-shell, jmeter, MongoDB.
